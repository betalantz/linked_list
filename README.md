# Create a  linked list (singly-linked)
- You will need a LinkedList class which gets instantiated with a @head Node object. 
- Your LinkedList class should have 4 instance methods 
    - one which allows a node to be inserted at an index, 
    - one which allows a node to be deleted at an index, 
    - one which retrieves a node at an index, and 
    - one which prints the whole linked list 
- You will need a Node class which holds data and a pointer to the next node. 
- You can choose to put methods in your Node class which allows insertion and deletion of an adjacent node, but be careful if you go this route! 
- Show me it works!
- BONUS: Create a .create_from_array class method in LinkedList
- DOUBLE BONUS: Make your .create_from_array class method run in O(n) time
